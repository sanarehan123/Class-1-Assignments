//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


// Program 1 written by Sana
// This program calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.

const num1: number = 5;
const num2: number = 3;
const sum: number = num1 + num2;
console.log("Sum:", sum);


// Program 2 written by Sana
// This program stores a favorite number in a variable and prints a message revealing the favorite number.

const favoriteNumber: number = 7;
const message: string = `My favorite number is ${favoriteNumber}.`;
console.log(message);
